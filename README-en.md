A Journey Through Design Patterns in the Audi World

Welcome to the **Quattro Design Patterns** tutorial! Here, we will explore the wonderful world of design patterns through real-life examples from Audi cars. Just like Audi's Quattro system, design patterns will help your code remain stable and efficient on complex roads.

### Introduction

Have you ever lost your way on the highway of programming? Do you wish for a roadmap to guide you through the complex world of code? Fear not; design patterns are like your navigation system! They provide reliable solutions, helping you avoid detours in development.

In this tutorial, we will illustrate each design pattern using different features of Audi cars. Imagine how to use the **Singleton Pattern** to create a unique Audi MMI system, or how to use the **Factory Method Pattern** to produce your dream Audi model.

### Categories of Design Patterns

We classify design patterns into three main categories:

1. **Creational Patterns**: Deal with object creation mechanisms.
   - Singleton Pattern
   - Factory Method Pattern
   - Builder Pattern
   - Prototype Pattern

2. **Structural Patterns**: Deal with the composition of classes and objects.
   - Adapter Pattern
   - Bridge Pattern
   - Composite Pattern
   - Decorator Pattern
   - Facade Pattern
   - Flyweight Pattern
   - Proxy Pattern

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Deal with object interaction and responsibilities.
   - Chain of Responsibility Pattern
   - Command Pattern
   - Interpreter Pattern
   - Iterator Pattern
   - Mediator Pattern
   - Memento Pattern
   - Observer Pattern
   - State Pattern
   - Strategy Pattern
   - Template Method Pattern
   - Visitor Pattern

### How to Use This Tutorial

1. **Clone This Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wanxb/QuattroDesignPatterns.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:
   Open the project in your code editor.

3. **Select a Design Pattern**:
   Run the program and choose the design pattern you wish to experience.

### Project Structure
